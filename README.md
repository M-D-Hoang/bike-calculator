# Better Bike Calculator

## Acceleration Calculator

### Calculate and Visualize Acceleration Curves

* Tweak system parameters, aerodynamic factors, and friction parameters.
* Visualize the speed over time of the acceleration curves.
* Compare your setups.
* Hover the curves to get time at given speed.
* Calculate top speeds.

## Time Calculator

### Calculate and Visualize Acceleration for a Given Distance

* Tweak system parameters, route parameters, aerodynamic factors, and friction parameters.
* Visualize the speed over time of the acceleration curves.
* Compare your setups.
* Calculate top speeds and travel times.

## Upcoming Features
